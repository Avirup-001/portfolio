            Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Avirup Banik and I'm currently working for <b><a href='https://flipkart.com' target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">Flipkart</a></b> as a <b>Software Engineer</b>. I am a self taught Full Stack developer with <b>2+ years</b> of experience. I have a strong passion for building modern,
            interactive web applications that provide a seamless user experience. In my time as a developer, I have learned how to effectively use a variety of technologies, including React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB and MySQL, to build full stack solutions.
            I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date on the latest developments in the web development ecosystem, and I am always looking for new challenges to help me grow as a developer.
            In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and participating
            in online coding challenges to keep my skills sharp. I am excited to continue my journey as a Full Stack developer and to work on exciting projects that push the boundaries of what is possible on the web.
